## 🐍 Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in web development, data science, automation, machine learning, scripting, and more.

### ✨ Key Features of Python

* **Easy to Read and Write**: Python uses clean and straightforward syntax.
* **Interpreted Language**: No need to compile; you can run code directly.
* **Dynamically Typed**: No need to declare variable types.
* **Extensive Libraries**: Huge collection of libraries for various tasks.
* **Community Support**: Large and active developer community.

### 📦 Example Code

#### 1. Hello World

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

#### 2. Variables and Data Types

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
is_active = True
```

#### 3. Conditional Statements

```python
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are underage.")
```

#### 4. Loops

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
✅ Explanation:
for is a loop keyword in Python. It's used to repeat some code multiple times.

range(5) generates a sequence of numbers from 0 up to (but not including) 5 → so: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

i is a variable that takes each value from the range, one at a time.

print(i) prints the current value of i in each loop iteration.

#### 5. Functions

```python
def greet(user):
    return f"Hello, {user}!"

print(greet("Bob"))
```

✅ Explanation:
def greet(user): defines a function named greet that takes one input called user.

return f"Hello, {user}!" returns a greeting message.

f"Hello, {user}!" is an f-string that lets you insert the user variable into the string.

greet("Bob") calls the function and sends "Bob" as the input.

print(...) prints the returned greeting to the screen.

### 🔧 Common Use Cases

* Web development (e.g., Django, Flask)
* Data analysis (e.g., Pandas, NumPy)
* Machine learning (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
* Automation and scripting
* Game development
* APIs and backend services
